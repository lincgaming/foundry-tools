## WARNING
The content within this repository is being shared not with the intent of having users download and execute the code within.  Rather, it is intended as a location to share knowledge and give people ideas on how to solve similar problems, hopefully in much better ways than shown here.  The majority of the scripts within this repo have not been tested, have the possibility of causing real data loss, and are generally written quickly and with only the needs of the operator in mind.
-----

With that out of the way, I hope some of the components within are helpful and will allow to preform the more tedious parts of Foundry world building so you can focus more on making wonderful and interesting content for your players.
